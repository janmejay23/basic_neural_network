X 	Input dataset matrix where each row is a training example
y 	Output dataset matrix where each row is a training example
l0 	First Layer of the Network, specified by the input data
l1 	Second Layer of the Network, otherwise known as the hidden layer
syn0 	First layer of weights, Synapse 0, connecting l0 to l1.
* 	Elementwise multiplication, so two vectors of equal size are multiplying corresponding values 1-to-1 to generate a final vector of identical size.
- 	Elementwise subtraction, so two vectors of equal size are subtracting corresponding values 1-to-1 to generate a final vector of identical size.
x.dot(y) 	If x and y are vectors, this is a dot product. If both are matrices, it's a matrix-matrix multiplication. If only one is a matrix, then it's vector matrix multiplication.
